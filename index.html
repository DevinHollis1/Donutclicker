                        Ever since I was a child, drawing has been one of my favorite ways past time. From the moment I could hold a pencil, I found joy in what I could create on paper. Drawing allowed me to express my imagination and bring my thoughts to life. Having this skill has allowed me to have a broad imagination and stay creative in whatever I'm doing!
